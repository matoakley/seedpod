<h1>Welcome to SeedPod!</h1>

<p class='lead'>
  We want to get more people growing their own food. We know that food you've grown yourself tastes better. How can we prove that? Well you know it yourself whenever you make a meal from scratch rather than just heating a packet in the microwave. Tucking into a meal you've put thought and time into is a whole lot more rewarding than eating any kind of 'ready-meal' from a supermarket. Well take it from us that cooking a meal based on vegetables you've grown yourself takes that satisfaction to a whole new level - trust us!

  At SeedPod we make the whole process of growing your own vegetables easier: our bespoke growing programme means you sow the right seeds, at the right time. Each monthly SeedPod is delivered straight to your letter box, and contains three types of organic vegetable seed. We also provide you with the guidance you need for sowing the seeds and nurturing the plants.
  
  Best of all we let you know when we think it might be time to harvest the vegetables, and ways you might like to cook and eat them too. That's why we call it 'Guided Vegetable Growing': we're with you at every step from sowing to eating.
