		Know someone who would love to grow their own, but has never managed to get started? Or a keen gardener who wants to take the hassle out of buying seeds? Perhaps you're looking for an original gift that's fun and great for the environment? We think our monthly vegetable seed subscriptions make perfect gifts for loads of special occasions. We offer a range of gifting options, and most of them include a discount when compared to our £6.00 month-by-month subscription. The more you spend, the more you can save! Here are the options:

	When you purchase a gift subscription you will recieve a gift code that you can either forward to your lucky recipient or print out and pop in a card. If you prefer, you can let us know their email address and we will send the code directly to them on your preferred date. All they need to do is create their own account, and enter the gift code. They will then be rewarded with a fantastic variety of veggie seeds as well as receiving clear, simple advice on how to get the most from them. Everytime they take a bite from a homegrown vegetable, they will think of you! All you need to do is select your gift option, enter some details, and you will be forwarded on to our secure payment page.
