<p>This month's SeedPod is now on its way to you! There's no denying it - Autumn is here, bringing with it crisp crimson leaves, even crisper air, and wonderfully warm bonfires. We have two corking seeds for you this month: broad beans that will provide a crop for you in the Spring, and chives for you to grow indoors and provide you with fresh herbs over the Winter.</p>
<p>Everything you need to help you sow and grow can be found in your <a href="http://www.getseedpod.com/pods/this_month">November growing guidance</a>. We think you'll love the taste of the broad beans, and we know you'll love the instant gratification as your herbs shoot to life in a matter of weeks. Do remember to let everyone know how you're getting on by posting photos and questions on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getseedpod">Facebook</a> page and on <a href="https://twitter.com/SeedPod">Twitter</a>! We'd love to hear how you're growing is going, so don't be shy.

<p>Best wishes,<br/>
	the SeedPod team</p>
