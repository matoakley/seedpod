<p>This month's SeedPod is now on its way to you! In order to extend the taste of Summer we're sending you seeds to grow fresh and tasty rocket for salads, as well as crisp pak choi - perfect for a stir fry.</p>
<p>You also now have access to the <a href="http://www.getseedpod.com/pods/this_month">September growing guidance</a>. It's your handy guide to sowing your seeds, caring for your plants as they grow and, later in the year, advising you when to harvest. Remember to let everyone know how you're getting on by posting photos and questions on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getseedpod">Facebook</a> page and on <a href="https://twitter.com/SeedPod">Twitter</a>!

<p>Best wishes,<br/>
	the SeedPod team</p>
