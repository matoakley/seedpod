You'll soon be receiving your first delivery from SeedPod. Before it arrives, there are one or two things you could do to prepare your garden. This advice is meant to make your growing experience easier and help you to produce healthier plants. 

<ul>
	<li>Prepare your soil: make sure whenever you are sowing or planting directly into garden soil that it's been loosened with a garden fork or spade. Adding organic matter (either a soil improver or compost from your local garden centre, or even better your own garden compost) would be ideal. Improving the condition of your soil will make sure it contains sufficient nutrients for your plants. It will also improve moisture retention. You'll be amazed at the difference this will make from planting in unimproved topsoil.</li>
	<li>Start your own compost heap: We'll provide more detail on this later, but in simple terms start collecting your vegetative matter (e.g. grass cuttings and vegetable scraps) as well as shredded paper from your unwanted mail. Mix them up in as large a container as possible, and keep it moist. </li>
	<li>Tools: As a bare minimum we would advise that you have a small and large digging implement, such as a trowel and large garden fork, a seed tray or propagator (any high sided tray with holes in the bottom), some pots (for over winter), potting compost and labels (anything to help you identify your plants). </li>
	<li>Space: If you'd like, you could build some fancy raised beds, but it really isn't necessary. Remember, we're keeping this simple. By all means, clear away some space in an unloved flower bed or dig up a patch of lawn you don't use. However, even that isn't really necessary - your veggies will live happily around other plants and don't need a dedicated plot. Wherever you chose, you need decent soil, lots of sun and a bit of shade. </li>
</ul>
